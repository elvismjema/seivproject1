      <h3>What Do Software Engineers Do?</h3>
      <p>
        Software engineers design, develop, test, and maintain computer software and systems. 
        They apply principles of computer science, mathematics, and engineering to create applications, 
        platforms, and tools that solve real-world problems. Software engineers often specialize in areas 
        such as web development, mobile apps, artificial intelligence, or cloud systems. 
        Collaboration, problem-solving, and continuous learning are key parts of the job.
